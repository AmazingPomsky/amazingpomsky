	<p>Cute, silly, and suited for apartment life, the Pomsky is a dog who likes to be the center of attention, and with their adorable looks and playful antics, they often get the adoration they crave.
	
	Their unfortunate start as a designer breed mixed between Siberian Husky and Pomeranian parents hasnâ€™t stopped them from earning popularity with dog lovers. Unfortunately, those who rush to buy Pomsky puppies from breeders are often overwhelmed and unprepared for their needs, and dogs of this breed sometimes find themselves left at shelters or with rescue groups.</p>
